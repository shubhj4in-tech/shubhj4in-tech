## Hi there 👋

# What's up, Shubh here. Thanks for stopping by!

I'm studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Stanford. Right now I'm building applied AI systems across multilingual NLP, autonomous agents, and consumer products. On campus, I'm focused on systems, infrastructure, and turning ideas into deployed products.

## Research & Engineering

I'm interested in retrieval systems, agent infrastructure, robotics data workflows, and applied AI that survives real-world constraints.

I built **Aapka Nyay**, India's largest legal-aid AI platform (142,000+ users), designing a multilingual RAG pipeline over IPC/CrPC and state acts with safety filtering and human escalation. The system was acquired after scaling nationally.

I co-founded **Dravn**, a community-driven fitness app with an embedded AI recovery and nutrition engine. I built the iOS MVP with a Supabase backend and designed the system architecture for behavioral nudges and automated insights.

I've also worked on growth and infrastructure systems at YC-backed startups, helping scale revenue engines, API adoption, and creator ecosystems for AI-native products.

Right now, I'm exploring:
- Shared memory layers for multi-agent systems
- Latency-aware model and tool selection
- Compute budgeting in autonomous agents
- Large-scale human POV data pipelines for robotics

## Arts and Hobbies

When I'm not building systems, I'm usually playing basketball, running long distances, or studying poker theory. I'm fascinated by decision-making under uncertainty and how incentives shape behavior, both in markets and in code.

## Fun Facts

- I built and exited my first AI startup before starting college.
- I've worked across legal tech, consumer AI, and generative audio systems.
- I'm interested in infrastructure problems most people don't notice.
- I think friction in systems is often a feature, not a bug.
