## Hi there 👋 Shubh here. Thanks for stopping by!

I'm studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Stanford. Right now I'm building applied AI systems across multilingual NLP, autonomous agents, and consumer products. On campus, I'm focused on systems, infrastructure, and turning ideas into deployed products.

# Research & Engineering

I'm interested in retrieval systems, agent infrastructure, robotics data workflows, and applied AI that survives real-world constraints.

I built **Aapka Nyay**, India’s largest legal-aid AI platform (142,000+ users), designing a multilingual RAG pipeline over IPC/CrPC and state acts with safety filtering and human escalation before the system was acquired. I co-founded **Dravn**, a community-driven fitness app with an embedded AI recovery engine, building the iOS MVP on Supabase and designing its behavioral and insight architecture. I’ve also worked on growth and infrastructure systems at YC-backed **Friday**, and at **Fish Audio**, where I built creator acquisition and API adoption systems for a $4M ARR generative AI company.


Right now, I'm exploring:
- Shared memory layers for multi-agent systems
- Latency-aware model and tool selection
- Compute budgeting in autonomous agents
- Large-scale human POV data pipelines for robotics

# Hobbies

When I'm not building, I'm usually playing basketball, analysing my chess game, or studying poker theory. I'm fascinated by decision-making under uncertainty and how incentives shape behavior, both in markets and in code.

# Fun Facts

- I built and exited my first AI startup before starting college.
- My friends call me the 'vibecoding demon'.
- I want to finish the Ironman marathon before I am 25.
